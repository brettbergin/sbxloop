# Changelog

All notable changes to sdxloop are documented here. The project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) and both distributions (`sdxloop`,
`sdxloop-worker`) release in lockstep.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-22

Initial release.

- **Sandbox-pair primitive**: every run provisions an agent sandbox
  (`COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` only, proxied to the Copilot API hosts) and a
  github-ops sandbox (`GH_TOKEN` only, built-in secret service), both under
  the balanced network policy with per-role allow rules, guaranteed cleanup
  (context manager + atexit/signal registry), and `--app-name` isolation.
- **Loop engine**: DECOMPOSE → PLAN → EXECUTE → SCRUTINIZE → VERIFY →
  VALIDATE with revision/replan budgets, read-only critic sessions,
  mechanical verification, SQLite checkpointing after every transition,
  crash-safe `resume`, wall-clock budgets, and cancellation.
- **Worker runtime** (`sdxloop-worker`): file-based job protocol with JSONL
  event streaming, GitHub Copilot SDK backend (lazy `[copilot]` extra),
  deterministic echo backend for testing, GitHub ops via gh CLI or
  pure-stdlib REST.
- **Worker delivery**: the host wheel embeds the worker wheel, so sandbox
  provisioning works before/without PyPI.
- **CLI**: `run` (rich live TUI), `resume`, `cancel`, `status`, `logs`,
  `sandbox ls/rm`, `config show`, `init`, `doctor`.
- **CI/CD**: ruff format+lint, mypy strict, pytest with 85% coverage gate
  (3.11–3.13), build with vendored-wheel assertion, PyPI Trusted Publishing
  on tags, manually-dispatched real-sbx e2e workflow.
