# sbxloop architecture

sbxloop orchestrates agentic loops on top of [Docker Sandboxes](https://docs.docker.com/ai/sandboxes/)
(the `sbx` CLI). This document describes the system layers, the security
model, and the run lifecycle.

            inside each sandbox: sbxloop-worker
            (JobRunner + agent backends + githubops executor)
```

Two distributions ship from this repo in lockstep versions:

- **`sbxloop`** — everything above the line: the host orchestrator.
- **`sbxloop-worker`** — the in-sandbox runtime. The host package embeds the
  worker wheel (`sbxloop/_vendor/`) at build time so sandboxes can be
  provisioned with no dependency on PyPI availability of sbxloop itself.
  `github-copilot-sdk` sits behind the worker's `[copilot]` extra, so the
  host never installs the Copilot runtime.

## The security primitive: one run = two sandboxes

Every run provisions a **pair** of microVM sandboxes via `Provisioner.ensure_pair`.
The github sandbox exists only when the GitHub integration is configured
(`[github] repo = "owner/repo"`); without it, `pair.github` is `None`, `GH_TOKEN`
is not required, and the run has no GitHub capability at all:

|            | agent sandbox                                                                                                                                                           | github sandbox                    |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| name       | `sbxloop-<run>-agent`                                                                                                                                                   | `sbxloop-<run>-github`            |
| credential | `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` only                                                                                                                                             | `GH_TOKEN` only                   |
| injection  | `sbx secret set-custom`, bound to `api.github.com` (PAT→Copilot token exchange; the exchanged token lives in SDK memory, so copilot API hosts need only network allows) | built-in `github` secret service  |
| network    | balanced policy + copilot hosts + plan-declared grants                                                                                                                  | balanced policy + github hosts    |
| runs       | Copilot SDK agent sessions, shell checks                                                                                                                                | `github.op` jobs (gh CLI or REST) |

Under the default `proxy` secret strategy, sbxloop first attempts sbx's
keychain-backed injection, where **token values never enter the VM**.
Field reality (sbx 0.35): that injection feeds only the interactive agent
sessions sbx launches — never `sbx exec` processes — so provisioning
verifies visibility and **auto-falls-back to an in-VM env file**
(`~/.sbxloop/env.sh`, chmod 600) when the env is invisible, emitting a
`sandbox.secret_env_fallback` event. In fallback mode the token value is
visible inside its own microVM, but the credential *split* still holds
(each sandbox only ever receives its own token) and egress remains bounded
by the balanced network policy.

Both sandboxes run under sbx's **balanced** network policy (default-deny plus
a curated allowlist), with per-sandbox allow rules added for exactly the
hosts each role needs. By default sbxloop shares the user's normal sbx
application state (so `sbx login` and `sbx policy init balanced` apply
directly); setting `app_name` in config opts into isolated sbx state, which
then needs its own `sbx --app-name <name> login` and policy init. The `plain-env` fallback strategy (tokens
written to `~/.sbxloop/env.sh` in-VM) exists for hosts where the experimental
`set-custom` proxying is unavailable, and is documented as weaker.

Beyond the static baseline, egress is **plan-declared and grant-late**: the
PLAN phase may declare extra domains a task needs during EXECUTE (each with a
justification), validated against operator bounds (`[policy] allow` /
`[policy] deny` in sbxloop.toml — out-of-bounds requests fail plan
validation) and applied via `sbx policy allow network <domain> --sandbox <agent>` only at EXECUTE entry. Every grant and refusal is emitted as a
`policy.allow` / `policy.deny` run event, so the persisted event log doubles
as an egress audit trail (`sbxloop logs RUN --type policy.`); `sbxloop config policy` renders the effective per-phase policy. sbx 0.35 has no
revocation primitive, so grants persist for the sandbox's lifetime
(SCRUTINIZE/VERIFY inherit them) but never outlive a run — sandboxes are
removed at run end and `resume` provisions fresh ones.

Cleanup is guaranteed by `SandboxPair` (context manager) plus a process-wide
registry hooked into `atexit` and SIGINT/SIGTERM: aborted runs do not leak
microVMs. Sandboxes are **cattle** — `resume` always provisions a fresh pair.

## The loop

```
outcome ─▶ DECOMPOSE (task DAG) ─▶ per task, dependency order:
             PLAN ─▶ EXECUTE ─▶ SCRUTINIZE ─▶ VERIFY ─▶ VALIDATE ─▶ done
                       ▲            │revise            │fail        │reject
                       └────────────┴──────────────────┘            ▼
                       PLAN ◀── (plan cleared, revisions reset) ─ replan
```

- **DECOMPOSE** — one agent session turns the outcome into a validated task
  DAG (unique ids, resolvable deps, acyclic; `max_tasks` budget).
- **PLAN** — fresh session produces steps, expected artifacts, and
  verify commands for one task.
- **EXECUTE** — fresh session with full tool access does the work in the
  run workspace.
- **SCRUTINIZE** — a fresh session in the *same sandbox* with **read-only
  permissions** reviews the work against plan + acceptance criteria, with
  evidence gathered mechanically (`git status`, `git diff`). Fresh session:
  no anchoring to the executor's claims. Read-only: the critic cannot "fix"
  things. Same sandbox: the workspace under review is preserved.
- **VERIFY** — mechanical: the union of task and plan `verify_commands` must
  all exit 0. No LLM.
- **VALIDATE** — fresh read-only session judges each acceptance criterion.

Failures loop with budgets: scrutiny revisions and verify failures re-EXECUTE
with feedback (`max_revisions_per_task`); validation rejections re-PLAN with
the plan cleared (`max_replans_per_task`). Exhaustion fails the task, skips
its dependents, and finishes the run `failed`. A wall-clock budget bounds the
whole run.

Structured JSON phases are validated against pydantic models with one retry
that feeds the validation error back to the agent.

## Persistence and resume

`StateStore` is a WAL-mode SQLite database at `<state_dir>/state.db` with
four tables: `runs`, `tasks`, `phase_attempts`, `events`. A row is committed
after **every** state transition. Infrastructure failures propagate after
persisting — a crash and a `kill -9` look identical to the store — and
`resume`:

1. re-provisions a fresh sandbox pair,
2. reloads task records (plans included),
3. continues from the last committed transition. A phase whose result was
   never committed re-runs from its start; nothing is replayed.

## Events

Everything observable is an `Event` (versioned JSONL envelope, shared model
in `sbxloop_worker.protocol`). Workers emit `worker.*`, `agent.*`, `gh.*`;
the host adds `run.*`, `task.*`, `phase.*`, `sandbox.*`. All events flow
through the host `EventBus` (synchronous, subscriber-exception-isolated) and
are persisted to SQLite — the CLI TUI, `logs --follow`, and hooks like
`GithubReporterHook` are all just bus subscribers.

See [worker-protocol.md](worker-protocol.md) for the host↔worker contract.
